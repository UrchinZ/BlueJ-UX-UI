From interviewing a few RPI students:
UI requirement
1. search bar needs to be on the top of the page
    - resize based on page size (for splitting screen/multi-tasking)
2. magnifying glass or some way of indicating "search"
3. want to be able to see more of the snippet (expand)
    - peek more
4. readable search results
    - font, color (not purple), space in between
5. Make it simple
    - not too many ads
